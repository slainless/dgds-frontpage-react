A simple prototype and implementation of `ＤＩＧＩＤＥＳ` frontpage using React.

Tech stack:
- Gatsby, v3
- Chakra UI, v1

Some dependency are actually unused or redundant, but let's leave it at that.

## State

Recently updated to locally serve majority of the resources but still outdated, from source perspective.

Currently implemented pages:

- Landing
- Feature
- Privacy policy
- Help center
- Article
- Contact

Some pages are not implemented.

Flair such as animation etc. was planned but in current state, this simple project is pretty much complete as a prototype/demonstration. No further improvement planned anymore.
